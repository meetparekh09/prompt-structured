# Introduction

FooCoffee has been selling high quality coffee to end consumers for over 40 years now.
Yet for the last decade, our profits keeps declining to the point that they are now negative.
This analysis ponders why, weighs alternatives, and proposes a plan for action.

# Pros and Cons
## Strengths

Clara, senior marketing specialist, mentions: "Our brand recognition in the
Tristate area is high, and this is the only area we are actively involed in. Our
logo is recognized by over 40% of respondents."

Steve, junior researcher, mentions: "The new packaging saves 4% of materials
-- these don't have a huge impact on our margins, but every bit helps".

## Weaknesses

Sandra, director of finance, mentions: "Our biggest expenses are employee
salaries and production costs, but production costs keep increasing over time
while our revenues are the same or worse than before".

Greg, senior technical analyst, mentions: "Although our website has significantly
more visits per day than before, we don't have automated shopping cart
system or a payment gateway -- customers are still required to email or fax their
orders."
